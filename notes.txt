Everything for simple calculator will be generated with javascript.
    We will house everything for sanity sake inside a div called main_container
    Figure out how to generate all the buttons that will live inside main_container
    Make a special div for the text field which display either:
    	 The answer
	 The calculation to be solved

    How to parse through an equation


    NOTES:
	On createElement() - Once this thing is created it is in face a complete object
	   there is no mystery to unfold. You can manipulate it all you want and just
	   dump it in an existing element.
	   Apparently the thing to do is set outerHTML. Setting innerText provided nothing.
	   The element created need to be appended to its parent before we can do anything
	   meaningful with that thing, beyond just setting up.

	Working though how to propperly form the equation based on what I need to solve
	   propper.
	   Mutate equation based on parens first
	   	  If a left paren is found
		     and the item just prior is a number
		        Add a multiply token just before the paren
		        I think thats all I need to look for
		  If a right paren is found
		     and the item just after is a number or is a left paren
		        Add a multiply token just after the paren
